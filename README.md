# TODOLIST

Why?
The purpose of this Todo List mini project is to practice your "VanillaJS" skills and consolidate your understanding of The Elm Architecture (TEA) by creating a real world useable App following strict Documentation and Test Driven Development.

This will show you that it's not only possible to write docs and tests first, you will see first hand that code is more concise, well-documented and thus easier to maintain and you will get your work done much faster.

These are foundational skills that will pay immediate returns on the time invested, and will continue to return "interest" for as long as you write (and people use your) software!

It's impossible to "over-state" how vital writing tests first is to both your personal effectiveness and long-term sanity. Thankfully, by the end of this chapter, you will see how easy it is.

What?
Build a fully functional "Todo List" Application!
Along the way we will cover:

 Building an App using a pre-made CSS Styles/Framework!
 The Document Object Model (DOM) + JSDOM
 Browser Routing/Navigation
 Local Storage for Offline Support
 Keyboard event listeners for rapid todo list creation and editing!
We will be abstracting all "architecture" related ("generic") code into a "mini frontend framework" called "elmish". (elmish is inspired by Elm but only meant for educational purposes!)

The journey to creating elmish is captured in elmish.md and fully documented code is in elmish.js. This means our Todo List App can be as concise and "declarative" as possible.

Todo List?
If you are unfamiliar with Todo lists, simply put: they are a way of keeping a list of the tasks that need to be done.
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Setting_priorities_and_goals

Todo Lists or "Checklists" are the best way of tracking tasks.
