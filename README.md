# TODOLIST

Why?
The purpose of this Todo List mini project is to practice your "VanillaJS" skills and consolidate your understanding of The Elm Architecture (TEA) by creating a real world useable App following strict Documentation and Test Driven Development.

This will show you that it's not only possible to write docs and tests first, you will see first hand that code is more concise, well-documented and thus easier to maintain and you will get your work done much faster.

These are foundational skills that will pay immediate returns on the time invested, and will continue to return "interest" for as long as you write (and people use your) software!

It's impossible to "over-state" how vital writing tests first is to both your personal effectiveness and long-term sanity. Thankfully, by the end of this chapter, you will see how easy it is.
